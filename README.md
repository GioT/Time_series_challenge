# Time series prediction challenge

The goal is to implement DNN approaches to predict a continous time series label from ppg and other features

This repo has 3 files of interest:
* `.vignettes/HL_predictions.ipynb` is the main notebook to follow to check model training and predictions
* `./python/functions.py` are simple helper functions
* `./python/model.py` is where the different model architectures are described

The data to run the code as well as different ouptuts are not included in this repo as it mostly hosts code.
